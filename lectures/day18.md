# Goals Today

As announced in [Topic: The goal for tomorrow's class is to get you into project groups](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/discussion_topics/3041693):

> Today, we're focusing on getting everyone into project groups. Although you
won't have to commit to a project idea until you submit your proposal after
spring recess, I'd like all of you to identify a project group and project idea
tomorrow. A reminder that a [Preliminary Project Proposal](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4811387) is due this Friday.

[Preliminary Project Proposal](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4811387) due tomorrow (Friday March 21, 2014) --> but why not get it done in class today!

> Before the spring break, I'd like you to report individually on what progress
you've made towards formulating a project. At the minimum, you need to describe
one idea of a project and identify at least one open data set. By identify, I
mean that you need to show that the data set is open, describe how anyone can
obtain the data (a URL pointing to the data set would be most helpful), and
detail what legal terms governs your use of the data.
