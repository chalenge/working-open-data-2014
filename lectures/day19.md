# Midterm 

* [Day_17_Midterm.ipynb](https://github.com/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_17_Midterm.ipynb)

# Bonus Tutorial Assignment

I know that some of you would like the chance to compensate for how you did on
the midterm. (Also for those of you happy with your midterm grade are welcome to
participate also.)

Everyone is welcome to create public Tutorials: an IPython Notebook on a topic
of relevance to the course, which I may have you present to the class in a 5-10
minute tutorial lecture. You will receive 5% for each tutorial (which I deem of
sufficient quality) up to a max of 4 tutorials; max grade for midterm +
tutorials not to exceed 40% in your course grade.

# Project Proposal Due tomorrow

[Project Proposal](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4743884)

# Weekly individual progress reports
 
I want *individual* progress reports every week until project presentations in class:

* [Project Progress Report 1](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4885126) (April 8)
* [Project Progress Report 2](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4885127) (April 15)
* [Project Progress Report 3](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4885128) (April 22)

(I may be modifying these assignments to have to publish your individual progress reports so that everyone can read them. I may also have us do peer-review.)

Questions:

* What have you done since your last report (or since the project proposal)?
* What specifically are you planning to work on this coming week?
* What are the major obstacles that stand in your way?

# Extended Hackathon

Think of the rest of the course as an extend hackathon -- we're working on building things, teaching each other, and having some
fun while learning.

Ask questions of me and each other.

I expect everyone to come to class, and I want your help to make the time we have in class as productive as possible.

I'll continue to publish supplementary materials aimed to help you with your projects on different fronts:

* [Day_19_B_HackFSM.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rdhyee/working-open-data-2014/blob/master/notebooks/Day_19_B_HackFSM.ipynb) -- also linked from [#HackFSM API Detail | Digital Humanities](http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/hackfsm/api/detail)
