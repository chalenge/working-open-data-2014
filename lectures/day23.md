Projects will work in groups of 2 to review each other's starter notebooks.  Your goals are:

* to understand the starter notebook of the other project
* to get the other project's notebook running on your laptop
* think about how that notebook can be improved
* document what anything you needed to do (such as installing dependencies or downloading data files) -- preferably as a github issue
on the other project's repository.
* bonus:  if you have improvements that can be merged directly into the repository, clone the repo and issue a pull request.
