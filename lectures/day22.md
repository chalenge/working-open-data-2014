# Announcements

* Luis Aguilar is the new Tutor for the course.  Welcome, Luis.  He'll be in touch with respect to setting office hours and contact info.

* Members of the IPython team will be visiting for a Q&A session next Thursday April 17.  Let's give some thought to questions you have.

* Note what I assigned last time -- which I've now formally put into bCourses: [Project Progress Report 1a: link to project repos and to starter notebook](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4914025)

* I've read all the progress reports.  I asked for information about your individual role in the project, and what you're doing
personally.  I gave reports 4/4 this time -- but will not do so unless I see some description of what you are doing
individually as part of your project.

* <http://www.mapshaper.org/> is the web interface to convert among shapefiles, geojson, and topojson I wanted to show you last time.
