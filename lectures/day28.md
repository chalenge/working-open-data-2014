# Goals Today

* course evaluation:  please provide honest feedback -- it's very helpful to me and the I School.
* I've graded everything that has been submitted, except the Baby Names notebook.  Expect at least 10/20 if you've submitted a minimally
functional notebook.  I have to work through which ones have made good faith creative efforts in exploring the data.
* If you still plan to submit a [tutorial notebook](http://rdhyee.github.io/wwod14/day19.html#%283%29), you need talk to me about getting an extension past the deadline (which was on [Monday](http://rdhyee.github.io/wwod14/day20.html#&284%29).)
* presentations

# Final Project Submission

**bcourse assignement**: [Final Project Submission](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4971892)

Your final IPython notebook is due at the beginning of class on Day 29 (May 6, 2014). I would
like both a digital and **paper copy of your notebook/report**.

In your report please include the following:

* a clear articulation of what problem you are solving with your project
* a clear description of what you proposed to do and what you ended up doing, describing what led you to go from what you proposed to what you ended up doing
* a thorough description of what is behind-the-scenes: what sources of data are you drawing from and how, how you are analyzing your data as well as the code to
analyze your data.
* **a clear description of your results and how to reproduce your results.**
* if you were to continue your project beyond the course, what would you do
* a paragraph that outlines how you split the work among group members and which describes your individual contributions to the work.

Update the [Project List](https://github.com/working-with-open-data-2014/project-organization/wiki/Working-with-Open-Data-2014-Projects) with a link to your final project notebook.

If you have any slides or supplementary materials from your presentations, feel free to upload them here or point to the materials.

# Open House

will be served.

(I expect everyone to be present unless you have talked to me and received an excused absense from me.)

# Invitation to Stay In Touch

* Feel free to reach out to me after the course is over.  I'd enjoy working with you all afterwards.
