# Reminder: Project Abstracts and Open House

I will be advertising the Open House for the course at the end of this week. Please
provide me a title and a short blurb (minimally, 75 words and not more 150 words)
describing your project that I can use to advertise your work by **Friday,
April 25, 2014 at noon PDT**.  Include a URL that points to where people will be able to find your completed IPython notebook.
Please get your notebooks in (more or less) final presentable form by Monday May 5, 2014 noon.
(You can start with a placeholder notebook with your abstract.)

Place your project abstract at
[Abstracts](https://github.com/working-with-open-data-2014/project-organization/wiki/Working-with-Open-Data-2014-Projects).


# Expectations for Final Projects and Presentations

It might be helpful for me to write down what I have said in class about my expectations for the projects.

## Presentations 

In your presentation, I would like to see the following:

* a clear articulation of what problem you are solving with your project
* a clear description of what you proposed to do and what you ended up doing, describing what led you to go from what you proposed to what you ended up doing
* a description of what is behind-the-scenes: what sources of data are you drawing from and how you are analyzing your data
* if you were to continue your project beyond the course, what would you do
* (optionally) a quick demo of your project

* We will have 10 minutes total/project -- 5 minutes of presentation + 5 minutes of Q&A/discussion. 

# Framing Questions for Discussions

* List any questions you have about the project.
* List a couple of aspects about the project that were done particularly well.
* Provide one or two suggestions about possible improvements or next steps for the project.

# Final report

Your final IPython notebook is due at the beginning of class on Day 29 (May 6, 2014). I would
like both a digital and paper copy of your notebook.

In your report please include the following:

* a clear articulation of what problem you are solving with your project
* a clear description of what you proposed to do and what you ended up doing, describing what led you to go from what you proposed to what you ended up doing
* a thorough description of what is behind-the-scenes: what sources of data are you drawing from and how, how you are analyzing your data as well as the code to
analyze your data.
* **a clear description of your results and how to reproduce your results.**
* if you were to continue your project beyond the course, what would you do
* a paragraph that outlines how you split the work among group members and which describes your individual contributions to the work.

# Open House

On the last day, we will host an open house on May 6, 2014 from 2:10 to 3:30 pm in 202 South
Hall. It's an open house. I'll be inviting people from the I School and the
larger community. Feel free to invite your friends to attend. Light refreshments
will be served.
